Prefer to make interfaces nonvirtual, using Template Method.

Prefer to make virtual functions private.

Only if derived classes need to invoke the base implementation of a
virtual function, make the virtual function protected.

A base class destructor should be either public and virtual, or
protected and nonvirtual.
